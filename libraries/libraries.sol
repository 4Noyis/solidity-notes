// What are Libraries in Solidity? 
/*
    - A library in solidity is a reusable piece of code that can be called by multiple smart contracts.
    
    - Libraries are similar to contracts, but they cannot be deployed on the blockchain independently.

    - Libraries ar edeplÄ±yed once and theri code is reused by other contracts, which saves gas and improves efficiency.

    - Library functions can be called directly if they do not modify the state. That means pure or view functions
    only can be called from outside the library.

    - A library cannot be inherited.
